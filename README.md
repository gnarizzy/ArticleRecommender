ArticleRecommender
==================

An article recommender created for Georgia Political Review. Since traditional recommender systems won't work here (GPR doesn't track user data), this recommender instead uses a naive Bayes algorithm to classify input into one of ten categories. The three most recent articles in that category are then served as recommendations.
